# Predictive Sales Analysis in the CRM Context: Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms

In this project, we explore the application of Machine Learning in CRM for sales predictions. Our focus includes average sales time, projected value, and identifying top-performing salespeople. We analyze various features such as product, company size, and market dynamics for precise predictions. Testing involves algorithms like Least Squares and K-Nearest Neighbors. The results showcase enhancements in predictions, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate algorithms and ensuring proper data preparation.
